cryptanalysis-tools
===================

Software designed for researching properties and characteristics of
cryptographic algorithms. The analysis becomes possible when researching the
small versions of real cryptographic algorithms (so called baby-ciphers with 16
input bits so far) and statistically expanding the result to the full version of
the algorithm. I'm currently researching if analyzing only some part of the full
cipher gives any good. Currently the linear and differential cryptanalysis is in
development. Other methods of cryptanalysis are also considered for
implementation.
